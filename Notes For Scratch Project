                      Scratch Project Notes

Idea for the project:

Sports game?
--> slapshot game, basketball game, baseball

Star Wars?
--> Trench Run, Jedi Training, Rescue mission

Running game?
--> simmilar to Temple Run
	--> Spacebar = jump, down = duck, left and right

Shooting game
--> aim with the mouse, click to shoot
	--> targets, skeet, monsters?

Minigolf
--> click and hold? Drag?

================
Adventure Games:
================

Harry Potter
Star Wars
Futurama

Avatar: The Last Airbender <--



											AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER
											==========================

--> give a name
--> pick an element/nation

--> "welcome to the {} nation"
--> "Practice bending" --> arrow key combos (ddr/guitar hero style?)
			* could do a bending practice and/or a dodging practice
			* Loop the practice until they succeed

--> destroy some cabages? ;)
--> save the day (different for each nation)
		* Different tasks of the same mission?
--> end the simulation


Air: Aang - Steering Aapa/Glider - Avoid fireballs
Water: Kataara - Sneaking past fire guards - Avoid guards

Earth: Toph - Fighting Earth Benders - GH Style
Fire: Zuko - Agni Kai with Zhao - GH Style

							-------------------
											AIR
							-------------------

--> Aang
--> Play airbending ball
		* Air hockey style
		* Pong?


							Final Level:
--> Escape the fire nation
		--> Avoid fire balls
			--> Ride glider/skybison
					* fly through rings with sky bison or glider

							-------------------
											WATER
							-------------------
--> Kataara

--> Rotate a shield around our character to block incoming
		attacks
		* Think of BrainGames -> planetary defender game

							Final Level:
--> Sneak past guards to rescue Aang?

							-------------------
											EARTH
							-------------------
--> Toph
--> Fight your way through the Earth Bending Cup
		* Guitar Hero style - Set combos, set speed, increased difficulties
		* 5 rounds?

									No Final Level


							-------------------
											FIRE
							-------------------
--> Zuko
--> Redirect lightning
		* mouse tracing game
			* set boundaries, if mouse pointer hits, restart
				Think of it like operation

										Final Level

--> Agni Kai vs Zhao
		* Guitar Hero style - Set combos, set speed

							Programming Notes
						======================


								Functions List:
								---------------

Greeting() --> Ask for name and nation/element

****
AIR
****

Score() --> keep track of airball score
						* first to 7 wins

CompMove() --> move the computer player
Move() --> let us move our player
* Can only move left or right
* Can't phase through boundaries or objects -> limit by position

bounce() --> bounce the "puck" off walls

Be careful in the corners! Going to need a way to avoid pinching

Final:
Fireball() --> need a fireball motion
* Could do from the bottom and top of screen, from no more than
	halfway across (x<=0) and shoot in angles
	* if top: -45< x <= -30
	* if bottom: 45 < x <= 30
Hit() --> if a fireball hits, we restart
	* if no fireball hits after 90 seconds, we succeed
Move() --> up and down with arrows as inputs?


******
WATER
******

ShieldMove() --> Left/right arrow to rotate, if object hits shield,
								 it will be reflected back

Final:
MazeBoundary() --> Don't allow things outside of boundaries
FireGuards() --> move guards in certain patterns
* Might need 2-3 different versions of this function for
	different movements -> different guard sprites?

Goal object: goal at each maze -> if reached, move on.

*****
FIRE
*****

MouseTrace() --> Track mouse and boundaries
								 If mouse hits boundary, restart

Could make each level timed as well...



*********************
EARTH and FIRE FINALS
*********************

GuitarHero() --> if the arrow mathces the holder and the input, we return
								 scores for how close it is to perfectly fitting.
								 5 points - perfect
								 3 points - great
								 2 points - good
								 1 point - poor
								 -1 point - miss

								 arrow object will have to be scored based on position
								 "if input: check which object is closest to input section
								 	if input and symbol match: check distance, give score
								 	if input and symbol don't match: miss score"

Earth Sequences and Fire Sequence must be stored somewhere

Earth Sequences - 5 different sequences

Sequences can be scored based off timer: under the hood, the timing of
inputs can be how things are scored and the overlay above can match that
timing.

Must achieve a certain score to succeed
